SimplePasscodeButtons
=====================

Someone on reddit requested this and I thought it'd be pretty easy, so I went for it. When an iOS device asks for your passcode it puts some letters underneath the numbers like this:

![NoModifications](http://i.imgur.com/mMN0CE4.png)

The person requested that the letters be removed like this:

![HideLetters](http://i.imgur.com/ae7FBGG.png)

And someone a while ago wanted all the text to be removed like this:

![HideLetters](http://i.imgur.com/w6EvuBy.png)

So I did both of those, and just added a setting so you can pick what you want, the default, hide the letters, or hide it all. Oh yeah, and this isn't under any license or anything so go wild.
